<div class="card-body"><p>The age factor becomes crucial; if your carpet exceeds 12-15 years without regular professional cleaning, replacement may be necessary as conditions like filter soiling, crushing, and traffic patterns can have significantly deteriorated the carpet, and a single cleaning cannot reverse decades of wear.</p>
